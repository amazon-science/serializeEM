# AKG_LLMER

Codebase for generalized entity resolution (KG) with (large) language models:  
(1) effect of entity serialization for pre-trained LM ([Ditto](https://github.com/megagonlabs/ditto)) and large models (Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B);  
(2) random walk-based representation for KG entities ([Highly Heterogeneous Knowledge Graph Datasets](https://github.com/IDEA-FinAI/Simple-HHEA/)) with [LLM2vec](https://github.com/McGill-NLP/llm2vec).
